## My process
I started making the HTML structure and once I have done that I looked for the styles (palette color, font-family). I tried to make the component as close as posible, I first starde with the desktop design and then mobile.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first component I make without tutorials and it's feels good when you realize a project by your own.
### Continued development

I'm going to keep focusing in frotend projects in order to my goal to become a fullstack developer.
